   npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   npm install @react-navigation/native@^6.0.0 @react-navigation/bottom-tabs@^6.0.0
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. Test on device:
   - Install Expo Go app on your phone
   - Scan QR code to run the app

### Option 2: React Native CLI

2. Initialize with compatible versions
3. Install dependencies manually
4. Run with `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`

## Backend Integration

The mobile app connects to your existing Python FastAPI backend:

1. Start backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
